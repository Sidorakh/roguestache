# About
Rogue Stache is an action-adventure platforming roguelike which draws heavy inspiration from hits such as Rogue Legacy, Risk of Rain, and Magicite. Explore vast interstellar dungeons and defeat hordes of cunning enemies!

# Comments
The code base is rather messy, a victim of feature-creep, and a "quick project" mentality.
The project took me a little over 2 years to solo develop in GameMaker Studio 1.4
